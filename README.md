# Man-of-the-Match-FIFA-2018
Recently I found this dataset on Kaggle and I am an avid football fan so I decide to create a simple project which predicts the man of the match award.

## Feature description
The dataset is not big, and it contains the following features (typical stats of a football match):

_1. Date_

_2. Team_

_3. Opponent_

_4. Goal Scored_

_5. Ball possesion %_

_6. Attempts__

_7. On-Target_

_8. Off-Target_

_9. Blocked_

_10. Corners_

_11. Offside_

_12. Pass Accuracy %_

_13. Saves_

14. Passes
15. Distance Covered (Km)
16. Foul Committed
17. Yellow Card
18. Yellow & Red Card
19. Red
20. 1st Goal
21. Round
22. PSO
23. Goals in PSO
24. Own Goals
25. Own Goal time

## Target/Goal of the project
The Target is the Man of the Match award.

Since the given dataset is not large, this project is created to practise feature importance/data visualization tools I learned recently.
